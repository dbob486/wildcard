To be able to play the game you have to download python.
Then open the console/terminal and type               pip3 import pygame

Then open the IDLE console and open the file main.py which should be inside the directory of where you cloned it.

Make sure that you are in the master branch when you run the code.
To play the game use the arrows to move and space bar to jump.

The 5 extra features are 
  1) You can loop around the screen over the sides
  2) I added colors to make the game look nice.
  3) I added friction to the player so they can slide.
  4)If you fall off the screen you lose.
  5) You can exit the game by clicking the top left button.
  6) my character is genderless because I'm about equality.
